    About Me:
    Hello! My name is Michael D. Maloney, and I am a software engineer based in Wilmington, NC. I specialize in
    designing,
    developing, and optimizing enterprise-level software solutions to provide seamless, high-performance digital
    experiences.

    My Journey:
    I began my journey in software engineering at the University of North Carolina Wilmington, where I pursued a
    Bachelor of
    Science in Information Systems, followed by a Master of Science in Computer Science and Information Systems. My
    educational path was not only about obtaining degrees but also a period of intense learning, exploration, and
    personal
    and professional growth. Graduating Magna Cum Laude from my master's program was a proud moment for me, symbolizing
    not
    only academic achievement but a deep engagement with my field of study.

    Professional Experience:
    My professional journey took a significant turn at Apiture, where I work as a Software Engineer. My role involves
    designing and architecting RESTful APIs and services for the Apiture Digital Banking platform, collaborating with
    cross-functional teams, and ensuring the platform's reliability through comprehensive testing frameworks. My tenure
    as
    an intern and then as a full-time engineer at Apiture has been a remarkable period of growth, filled with
    opportunities
    to lead projects, innovate, and contribute to a culture of excellence.

    Before joining Apiture, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. I
    developed a web-based system to automate operations and advising processes during my tenure. This project honed my
    skills in managing the software development lifecycle, from requirement gathering to deployment.

    Skills and Expertise:
    I possess a broad range of technical skills across various languages, databases, tools, and frameworks, including
    TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, SQL, Bash, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Docker, Git, Node.js, and
    more.
    This diverse skill set, combined with my expertise in system architecture, Agile methodologies, and project
    management,
    enables me to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative solutions.

    Looking Ahead:
    As I continue to grow in my career, my focus remains on leveraging technology to solve real-world problems,
    fostering a
    culture of innovation, and contributing to the tech community's knowledge base. I'm open to discussing technology,
    collaboration opportunities, or potential projects. Please don't hesitate to contact me through my LinkedIn or
    GitHub
    profiles or email me.

    Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to the possibility of working together to create
    something unique.
