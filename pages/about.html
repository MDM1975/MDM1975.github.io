                My name is Michael Maloney, and I am a software engineer based in Wilmington, NC. I have a deep
                interest in technology, problem-solving, and innovative systems, which has led me to pursue software
                engineering as my career. My main goal is to develop efficient, scalable, high-quality software
                solutions that tackle complex challenges and bring positive change. I am committed to creating
                software that delivers tangible results.

            <p>
                My journey in software engineering started with my fascination for technology and desire to
                understand how systems work. I have always enjoyed creating something from scratch and using
                technology to solve real-world problems. This passion has driven me to pursue software engineering
                as a career and motivated me to continue growing and evolving in this field.

                <strong>Education and Professional Experience</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
                I have earned a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and a Master's degree in Computer Science
                and Information Systems from the University of North Carolina Wilmington. During my academic years,
                I gained hands-on experience in software development, project management, and system design through
                internships and my role as a Graduate Research Assistant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at Apiture in Wilmington, NC. In my current role, I
                am responsible for designing and developing high-performance, RESTful APIs for the Apiture Digital
                Banking platform. This involves integrating systems to improve functionality and leading projects to
                improve operational efficiency significantly. I started as an intern at Apiture, and since then, I
                have taken on increasing responsibilities, from spearheading the development of new features to
                optimizing existing processes for better scalability and security.

                <strong>Skills and Expertise</strong>
            </h5>
            <p>
                I have extensive knowledge and experience in various programming languages and technologies. My
                proficiency includes TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, SQL, and Bash, which allows me to
                create and maintain flexible software solutions. I am also skilled in managing and optimizing
                databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and DynamoDB to ensure data integrity and
                performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enhance productivity and create a culture of continuous integration and continuous delivery
                (CI/CD), I use various tools such as Docker for containerization, Git and Bitbucket for version
                control, and Jira and Confluence for project management and collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
                I follow best practices in software development, emphasizing agile methodologies, system
                architecture, and design principles. This approach allows me to tackle complex challenges and create
                innovative, robust, scalable solutions. I am committed to excellence and continuously learning about
                the latest technologies and methodologies to ensure that I can contribute to my team and projects at
                the highest level.
