<ul>
  <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) uses a hierarchical classification system to organize software constructs into class hierarchies.</li>
  <li>The superclass is the parent class, and subclasses inherit its properties while offering flexibility to adapt or improve them according to their needs.</li>
  <li>Each subclass is a unique extension of the superclass, inheriting its attributes and methods and demonstrating distinct features or behaviors.</li>
  <li>Subclasses can modify inherited methods through method overriding, enabling them to replace or expand the base behavior with specialized functionalities.</li>
  <li>OOPâ€™s class hierarchy structure allows developers to design software applications in an organized and efficient manner, promoting the creation of streamlined, adaptable systems.</li>
  <li>Taxonomy, the biological classification based on shared traits, provides a useful metaphor in OOP for understanding and organizing complex code structures.</li>
  <li>OOP mirrors biological hierarchies through inheritance, facilitating the passing of attributes and behaviors from one class to another.</li>
