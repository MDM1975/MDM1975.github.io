Conditional types in TypeScript enable developers to create expressive and dynamic type definitions based on the relationships between types. They leverage the extends keyword to conditionally select types, similar to how ternary operators work in JavaScript. This feature is invaluable for creating types that adapt based on the inputs provided to them, allowing for more flexible and robust type definitions.

Conditional types are defined using the `extends` keyword and the ternary `expression ? if truthy : if falsy`. The `extends` keyword is used to check if a type extends another type, and the ternary operator is used to select the type based on the check result.

#### Basic Conditional Types

##### Truthy Type Checker

The Truthy type example demonstrates how to use conditional types to differentiate between truthy and falsy values in TypeScript. This pattern is convenient to enforce type safety based on the truthiness of expressions or values.

```ts
type Truthy<T> = T extends 0 | "" | false | null | undefined ? false : true;

type Foo = Truthy<0>; // false
type Bar = Truthy<1>; // true

type Fizz = Truthy<"">; // false
type Buzz = Truthy<"string">; // true
```

##### Object Type Checker

The ObjectType definition showcases conditional types' ability to distinguish between object types and other types, enabling type-safe operations on objects.

```ts
type ObjectType<T> = T extends Record<string, any> ? T : never;

type Foo = ObjectType<"">; // never
type Bar = ObjectType<{ key: string }>; // { key: string; }
```

##### Array Element Extractor

The ArrayType type illustrates how conditional types can infer and extract nested types, such as the element type of an array. This is a powerful feature for working with collections and their elements.

```ts
type ArrayType<T> = T extends Array<infer R> ? R : never;

type Bar = ArrayType<string>; // never
type Foo = ArrayType<string[]>; // string
```

#### Advanced Conditional Types

##### Recursive Strict Defined Type

The StrictDefined type example extends the concept of conditional types to recursively apply type transformations recursively, demonstrating how to enforce non-optional, non-null properties throughout an object structure. This advanced use case is essential for scenarios requiring strict type integrity at all levels of an object.

```ts
type StrictDefined<T> = T extends null | undefined
  ? never
  : T extends Record<string, unknown>
  ? { [K in keyof T]-?: StrictDefined<T[K]> }
  : T;

type Foo = {
  a?: string;
  b?: string;
  c?: { d?: string };
};

type Bar = StrictDefined<Foo>; // { a: string; b: string; c: { d: string; } }
```

#### Practical Applications and Considerations

- **Type Safety:** Conditional types enhance type safety by allowing developers to create precise type conditions and transformations based on the structure and relationships of the types involved.
- **Code Reusability:** By defining generic and conditional types, developers can create reusable type definitions that adapt based on the context in which they are used, reducing code duplication.
- **Advanced Type Manipulation:** Conditional types unlock advanced type manipulation capabilities, such as filtering types, extracting nested types, and applying transformations recursively, which are invaluable in complex TypeScript projects.

#### Conclusion

Conditional types are a cornerstone of TypeScript's type system, offering the flexibility and power to create sophisticated type definitions. For simple conditional checks or complex type transformations, conditional types provide the tools for writing type-safe and maintainable TypeScript code. As TypeScript continues to evolve, mastering dependent types will undoubtedly be an asset for any developer looking to leverage the full potential of the language's type system.
